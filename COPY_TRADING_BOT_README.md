- Exit Long orders (7-9) ‚Üí Copy as LONG position closes
- Exit Short orders (10-12) ‚Üí Copy as SHORT position closes

- This captures orders as soon as they are placed, not just when they are filled

## Configuration

Edit your `.env` file with:

- `KANA_API_KEY`: Your Kana Labs API key
- `KANA_WS`: WebSocket URL (default: mainnet)
- `APTOS_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX`: Your Aptos private key
- `APTOS_ADDRESS`: Your Aptos wallet address
- `TARGET_WALLET_ADDRESS`: The wallet address you want to copy trade from

## Copy Trading Settings

The bot includes configurable settings in the code:

- `copyTradingEnabled`: Enable/disable automatic copying (default: true)
- `copySizeMultiplier`: Size multiplier for copied trades (default: 1.0x)
- `maxCopySize`: Maximum size to copy (default: 0.001 BTC)
- `minCopySize`: Minimum size to copy (default: 0.0001 BTC)

## Stopping the Bot

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop the bot.
